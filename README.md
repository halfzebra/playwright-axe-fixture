# playwright-axe-fixture

This package aims to provide a better experience for accessibility testing with Axe and Playwright.

`AccessibilityFixture` attempts to re-create the API provided by Playwright's `Page` class, while also integrating Axe's accessibility snapshots, when DOM changes occur.

This package also comes with a custom reporter intended to be used along the way, which will gather the accessibility test results and present them in a user-friendly format.

## Usage

```ts

```
